# rss-reblog
Reblogger for RSS items

### What is this?

See my post about it here: ()

### CSS Hooks

Will write in more detail about it in a bit but for now see: 

https://github.com/bluetinge/rss-reblog/blob/main/sample.html

for the templates that are adeded onto a given post, and the relevant classes that are included in the templates. 

To style the button itself, you'll likely need to mark those classes as !important. See https://github.com/bluetinge/rss-reblog/blob/main/rss-button.css for the stylesheet for the button itself.
